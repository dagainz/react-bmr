# React BMR

This curerntly is a simple application that calculates your estimated basal metabolic rate
using a variety of commonly known calculations.

This functionality was part of a health suite that I previously wrote in python/django/bootstrap.

## About me

I have been programming both as a hobby and as a part of my profession for most of my life.
I've almost exclusively been working within the backend, and am now stating to try to expand my
repertoire to include frontend / full stack.

This is my first react applicatoin.
