# React BMR

This project will become a React single page application to calculate
BMR's (Basal Metabolic Rates) using a variety of algorithms.

At this point it does not yet run. All it contains is a sample layout (layout.html) written in HTML and css.

This is my first React application.

## About me

I have been programming for a long time, although it has been almost exclusively backend programming.
This is the first front end application that I have written from the ground up.
