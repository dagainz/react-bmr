# React BMR

This is a simple application that calculates your estimated basal metabolic rate
using a variety of commonly known calculations.

This functionality was part of a health suite that I previously wrote in python/django/bootstrap.

## Changelog

- Iniital Functionality
- Includes algorithms from sailrabbit.com/bmr
- Still missing overlay with calculation notes
