# React BMR

This is a simple application that calculates your estimated basal metabolic rate
using a variety of commonly known calculations.

# Why ?

I wrote a proof of concept body weight and nutrition tracker application in Python/django back when I was new to Python.
I still have the dream of maybe doing it properly one day. Its always in the back of my mind.

After taking a ReactJS course I was excited about the possibility rewriting the application using React for the front
end. To get a sense for the amount of effort involved in doing something like that, I decided to rewrite one small piece
of functionality that my old tracker did: A metabolic rate calculator.

As I got close to the finish line, I had a sad realization that an incorrect assumption I made early on painted me into
a corner that limited me from one of most important features was for the ability to easily add additional algorithms, so
the project died right there.

It did however serve the purpose, and it does work. 

The clickable help in the results pane does not work, and there are a couple style issues, but it is usable. I am going
to keep this repo up for now as an example, and maybe go back and finish it one day.
